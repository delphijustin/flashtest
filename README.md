# flashtest
Fake flash drive tester written in PHP

This script simply creates files onto the flashdrive to see if it is a real flash
drive or fake. All files created by this script should all be the same. It works
with all OSes that support PHP. NOTE THIS TOOL IS NOT MADE TO BE USED FROM A WEB
SERVER. Batch file is included for windows(with the files needed to run the tools).
And shell script for linux. Just run the batch file, with no parameters and follow
the instructions on the screen. If the Visual C++ Runtime is installed(Windows only)
then it should work without admin rights. Depending on how big the flash drive is the
test may take a few hours
